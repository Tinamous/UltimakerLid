Do not use this design. It appears the Pi Display has changed slightly making the cutout not work well. V1.2.2 has a larger cutout and is down a little to give a better fit.

Same as V1.2 (Draft excluder at rear and Pi Display) but 40mm higher (to make better use of 600x400 acrylic sheet + give more stable zone at the top with lack of airflow
